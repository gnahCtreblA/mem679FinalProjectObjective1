Hello!
This project folder contains all of the code for the first part of my objective.

The CUDAsetup.py file is the file I used for troubleshooting my CUDA installation.
The recaptcha v2 directory contains my dataset i used to train the model.
The yolov5 dataset contains the model I used.
The requirements file can be found inside of the yolov5 directory, as well as more detailed information regarding the model.
I downloaded the model from the Ultralytics github page.

These are the following lines of code I pasted into the terminal to train the model:
You have to run it from the yolov5 directory
so first:

cd yolov5

then:

python train.py --img 640 --epochs 100 --data data.yaml --weights yolov5s.pt

There is a data.yaml file in the data directory located inside of the yolov5 directory which points to my dataset.
It can be found here \mem679FinalProject\yolov5\data\

I used Roboflow to annotate my dataset.

After training is completed, the results are stored in the runs directory located inside the yolov5 directory.
It can be found here \mem679FinalProject\yolov5\runs\train\

My results from the runs I did will not be on github as it is excluded from the push.
The runs folder will be created when you train for the first time.
